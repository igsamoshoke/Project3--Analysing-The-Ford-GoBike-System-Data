# **Project: Ford Gobike Data Exploration**
## **by Igonor Oshoke**


## **Dataset**

> This project explores and analyses a dataset that contains trip data of the Ford Gobike of around 183,412 entries.
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. In this analysis, I will be using this data set to find trends between individual rides, Gender, Trip durations, age, Start Stations and related indicators and use this trends to answer quesions such as When most trips taken in terms of day of the week, or month of the year?, How long average trips take and other related questions.

### ***Summary of Findings***


> In the exploration of this dataset, I obtained insights on the average duration for all trips and ascertained that the average duration for all trips to be around 600 seconds. I also ascertained the day of week witht the most trips to be Thurdays and is followed by Tuedays, Friday, Wednesday and Monday (in descending order).Weekends have the least trip records, although longer duration compares to other weekdays. One interesting thing I also found is that Most of the rides (estimated more than 90%) were taken by subscribers and most of the total rides were taken by the male gender.

I found that most recorded users are aged between 20 and 45 and this showed that the higest trip durations were registered by younger users.

User type seems definitely to affects the ability of a user type to share his/her bike and i discovered that ont subscibers are able to do this.


### ***Key Insights for Presentation:***

> For this presentation, I will focus on the frequency of trips taken per day in a week, relationship between bike_share_for_all_trip and Customer type, relationship between Trip Duration and Age, the relationship between Trip Duration, Weekdays and User type and finally I explore the relationship between trip duration, gender and user type. I shall explore this using Seaborn's barplot, boxplot and others as well as matplotlib and its properties.

More explorations can be found in the code file.
